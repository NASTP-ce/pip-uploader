As a developer, once you've made changes in a **feature branch**, you should follow a **professional Git workflow** to ensure quality, collaboration, and traceability.

---

## ✅ Developer Workflow After Making Changes in a Feature Branch

### 📌 Assumptions:

* You are working on a branch like `feature/some-feature`.
* You have made local commits with meaningful messages.
* The remote `main` branch may have evolved during your work.

---

### 1. **Pull Latest Changes from `main` (Keep Branch Updated)**

Ensure your feature branch is up to date:

```bash
git checkout feature/some-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main  # OR git merge origin/main
```

> ✅ **Prefer `rebase`** for a clean history (linear), but only if your team prefers it and it's a personal branch.

---

### 2. **Test Your Changes Thoroughly**

* Run the application locally.
* Perform functional and edge case testing.
* Ensure UI elements, if any (like in PyQt), behave correctly.
* Fix any bugs or issues found.

---

### 3. **Format, Lint, and Validate Code Quality**

Use your tools:

```bash
black .          # Format Python code
isort .          # Sort imports
flake8 .         # Linting
```

Add/update tests if needed, and run them:

```bash
pytest
```

---

### 4. **Push Your Changes to Remote Feature Branch**

```bash
git push origin feature/some-feature
```

> 🔁 Repeat steps 2–4 as needed during active development.

---

### 5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**

On GitHub:

* Open a PR from `feature/some-feature` → `main`
* Title: `feat: add drag-and-drop file selection`
* Description should include:

  * **What** was done
  * **Why** it was done
  * Screenshots (if UI changes)
  * Issue references (e.g., `Fixes #12`)

> Optionally use a PR template for consistency.

---

### 6. **Request Code Review (If Teamwork)**

* Ask teammates to review.
* Respond to feedback and push changes (GitHub auto-updates PR).
* Keep commits clean and meaningful.

---

### 7. **Merge the PR (Once Approved and Tests Pass)**

Choose one of:

* ✅ **Squash and Merge** — single commit in `main`, good for keeping history clean.
* 📜 **Merge Commit** — preserves all commits (if needed).
* 🧼 **Rebase and Merge** — keeps linear history, can be used if team prefers.

---

### 8. **Delete Feature Branch (Optional)**

Once merged, delete it locally and remotely:

```bash
git branch -d feature/some-feature
git push origin --delete feature/some-feature
```

---

### 9. **Pull Latest `main` Locally**

Stay updated:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

### 10. **Tag & Release (Optional, if version bump)**

If your changes result in a version update:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0 - added new feature"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

Then go to GitHub → **Releases** → Draft new release.
