## 🤖 2. **GitHub Actions: Auto Tag & Changelog Generator**

Let’s set up an action that:

* Bumps the version (based on conventional commits)
* Generates changelog
* Creates GitHub release

### 📁 Create workflow file:

Path: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

### ⚙️ Content:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release and Tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: pip install commitizen

    - name: Create Release
      run: cz bump --yes --changelog
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Push Tags
      run: |
        git push --follow-tags
```

---

## ⚙️ 3. **Configure Commitizen**

Create a configuration file in your project root:
**`pyproject.toml` (append the following section)**

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
name = "cz_conventional_commits"
version = "0.1.0"
tag_format = "v$version"
changelog_file = "CHANGELOG.md"
```

---

## 🧪 4. **Usage Instructions (as developer)**

### Make a commit using Commitizen format:

```bash
cz commit
# Interactive prompt for type/scope/description
```

### Bump version manually (optional):

```bash
cz bump --yes --changelog
```

This updates:

* `pyproject.toml` version
* `CHANGELOG.md`
* Git tag pushed to GitHub

GitHub Actions then creates a **release automatically**.

---

## Optional Add-ons

* Add `pre-commit` hooks for `black`, `flake8`, and `cz check`.
* Use `bump2version` if you prefer manual control over versioning files.

---

Would you like me to generate:

* The complete `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
* Or a GitHub Action that **builds and uploads your PyQt app (.exe)** to releases when tags are pushed?
